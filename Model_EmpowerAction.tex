\section*{EmpowerAction: Decentralized Economy}

This document presents a comprehensive framework for our decentralized economy "EmpowerAction."
It focuses on the structuring and regulation of prices by supply and demand, balances, emissions, and token circulation, as well as on credit management within the system.

\subsection*{1. Product or Service Price}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The price is defined by supply and demand and is quoted in multiple cryptocurrencies.
    \item Product or service price in USD: \( P \)
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{2. Ecosystem Balance}
\subsubsection*{a. Revenues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transaction fees (to be defined): Possible fees are in the range: \( A \in [0.002, 0.04] \). Applied to transactions within the system.
    \item Tiered commission (To be defined): Loyalty Levels: \( N: f(x1,\ldots,x4) \). Loyalty levels can influence fees, offering incentives for frequent users.
    \item Commission for transactions \( C_m = P \times A \times N \). Commission based on price and loyalty levels.
    \item Commission for transactions paid with EMP (Native Token): \( C_{me} = P \times A \times N \times 0.5 \).
    \item Total revenues in USD: \( \text{ING} = \sum C_m + C_{me} \). Sum of all commissions to calculate total revenues.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{b. Expenditures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( M_f \in [0.001, 0.48] \): Factor representing the expense margin.
    \item Maintenance USD Expenses \( G_m \) (From highest to lowest, with a goal of 1\%): \( G_m = \text{ING} \times M_f \). Calculates maintenance expenses based on revenues and margin.
    \item USD Expenses Allocated to liquidity injection: \( R_yq = \text{ING} - G_m \). This determines the amount of money destined to increase liquidity in the system.
    \item EMP: Native Token. DOLLAR VALUE: \( \text{EMP}_v \). Defines the dollar value of the native token.
    \item Amount of EMP to repurchase and burn \( (EM)_q \): \( (EM)_q = R_yq / \text{EMP}_v \). Calculates the number of tokens to repurchase and eliminate.
    \item If \( R_yq \) Absorbs the total token supply, the rest is converted into \( R \). This condition ensures that the token supply and demand are balanced.
    \item USD Reserves (R): \( R = R_yq - (\text{EM}_q \times \text{EMP}_v) \).
    \item \( R \) is used to invigorate liquidity through various mechanisms decided by consensus and based on data. This allows the system to maintain smooth and efficient operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Token Issuance and Circulation based on credits (EMP and DEUS)}
Credit is issued when a user has insufficient funds to pay for services of a denomination less than 40\% of their total credit in USD on the platform. This will be released directly into the provider's account.

\subsubsection*{a. Issuance for Credit Used}
\subsubsection*{Mutual Credits}
\begin{align*}
    \text{CR}_d & \in \{x1,\ldots,x150\}, \text{ where } x \text{ represents the range of available credits.} \\
    \text{Total Credit in USD (CRDt):} & \text{ Linked to Reserves, total credit available in the system.} \\
    \text{CRuser} & = \text{CRDu} \times \text{ behavior factor, could be in the range } [0.5, 1.5]
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{EMP}
The amount of representative tokens is issued by the nominal value of the contracted service (Defined between parties). This links the tokens with the real value of the services.

\subsubsection*{Articulation}
\begin{align*}
    E_i & = \text{Initial amount of tokens in circulation.} \\
    \text{Debt issuance executed by Credit Used: CR}_e & = P. \text{ Based on the service price.} \\
    \text{EMP token issuance x Credit used: EMP}_e & = \text{EMP}_v \times \text{CR}_e\\
    \text{Total EMP issuance: EMP}_et & = E_{\text{initial}} + \sum \text{ EMP}_e - \text{EMP}_q. \\
\end{align*}

The borrower will receive “DUS” wrapped, non-transferable, and eliminable by the same platform. Debt Instrument.

\subsubsection*{DUS}

Payment is made in EMP or USD or ETH, releases its DUS debt quota, and allows Deleting DUS from its wallet. Allowing the platform to be used again. This provides a mechanism to manage and settle debts within the system.

\subsubsection*{Articulation}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Total credit in USD initially (CD):} &\ 10 \text{ Dollar per account, based on reserves.} \\
    \text{Value of Wrapped DUS:} &\ 1 \text{ Dollar} \\
    \text{Total DUS Issuance: DUS}_e & = \text{DUS}_v \times \text{CR}_e. \text{ Debt issuance.} \\
    \text{Total user debt issuance (DUS)}_u: &\ \text{DUS}_u = \sum \text{DUS}_e < D. \\
    \text{DUS Tokens to Burn: DES}_q & = \text{D}payment. \text{ Defines the tokens to be eliminated.} \\
    \text{Total platform debt issuance in dollars (DUS)}_t: &\ \text{DUS}_t = \sum \text{DUS}_u
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{4. Repurchase and Burn Policy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Burned Tokens \(EMq = \frac{Ryq}{EMP_v}\)
    \item If \(R_yq\) Absorbs the Total Token Offer:
    \item If \(EMP_q > \text{EMPtotal}\), then \(R = R + R_yq - (EMP_q \times EMP_v)\).
    \item If \(EMP_q < \text{EMPtotal}\), then \(R = R + 0\).
    \item Token offer update:
    \item \(EMPtotal\_new = EMPtotal - EMP_q\). Updates the total token supply in circulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{In summary:}
EmpowerAction proposes a robust and flexible decentralized economic system, with clear and transparent mechanisms for managing prices, commissions, tokens, and credits. The structure presented seeks to be a foundation for smooth and efficient operation, encouraging participation, transparency, and individual responsibility, allowing the necessary adaptability to changing market conditions.
